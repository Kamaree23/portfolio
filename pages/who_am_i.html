        <pre style="font-size: 25px ; color: black;" width="0%" class="pa">   Hey everyone! For starters, My name is Kamaree. I'm currently 22 years old and I was born in Paterson, New Jersey but raised in Georgia!
 I grew up with both my parents and lived a pretty normal. I was highly into band. If there's an instrument I've played it. Except the 
 harp. I could never really get my hands on one to try it out. On top of that i had a huge passion to code. Now growing up I understanding 
 the bare minimum of coding. I went through all of high school with coding in my mind and took all the buissness and technology classes I 
 could take to just try to get my foot in the door Soon after high school I came to the realization that I didn't want to go to school for 
 that long and that I would just try something else.</pre>
        <h1 class="Its_me"> Hopes and Dreams</h1>
    <pre style="font-size: 25px ; color: black;" width="0%" class="pa"> I ended up going to this Christain college for two years and it changed my life! I was able to learn tons of life values and because
 of that, I decided I would chase my dreams. I stumbled upon coding bootcamps and realized that this was my chance to finally get into 
 the coding world. I'm hoping to improve my problem solving skills through out these three months and build the foundation for what will
 be my future!
